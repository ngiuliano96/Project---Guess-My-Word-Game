### Guess My Word Game

Welcome to my basic word-guessing game, Guess My Word. The game is similar to Hang Man, where you can either guess a letter or a whole word. You have 6 tries to guess correctly, so good luck!

Behind the scenes:
This code takes a random word from a set list, splits it into a list of characters, and checks player guesses against both the list and the full word. Progress is tracked with a sister list of asterisks, which is filled over time with the correct characters.
